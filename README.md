3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing the project, some questions that I have about web development is how people think of designs as I was struggling on making my game stand out. Moreover, what was their process in thinking of a design that would be not too simplistic and not too stylish? Another question is what are the responsibilities of a web developer? Are the responsibilities of a front-end developer different from a back-end developer? Do front-end and back-end work on similar tasks and should front-end developers know/understand back-end and vise-versa? And how do websites get released onto the internet? One last question that I have regarding web development is how do web developers test/debug their codes to ensure that their website are working correctly and will not generate errors when it gets released to the public?
