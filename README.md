2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [YOUR ANSWER HERE]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing the project, some questions that I have about web development is how people think of designs as I was struggling on making my game stand out. Moreover, what was their process in thinking of a design that would be not too simplistic and not too stylish? Another question is what are the responsibilities of a web developer? Are the responsibilities of a front-end developer different from a back-end developer? Do front-end and back-end work on similar tasks and should front-end developers know/understand back-end and vise-versa? And how do websites get released onto the internet? One last question that I have regarding web development is how do web developers test/debug their codes to ensure that their website are working correctly and will not generate errors when it gets released to the public? 	

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add additional features to the page. Features like a navigation bar that would contain an image, information page, and about me page. If the user clicks the image, it would go back to the game, whereas the information would show some fun facts about the game and where it originated. As for the about me page, it would contain some information about me. 

Some other features that I would love to include would be a difficulty bar. Where the user can choose between three difficulties- easy, medium, and hard. If it is easy, then there would be fewer buttons, patterns and the speed of the game would be slower. Whereas the difficulty was hard, it would have more buttons, patterns and the speed of the game would be faster. And medium somewhere in between. I would also love to implement a statistic page where it would record the user’s game statistics, like the number of games the user won and lost in each difficulty.
